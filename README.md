Conway's Game of Life: Graphical zero-player cellular automaton game. User provides the "seed", or the games original configuration consisting of cells in one of two states - Alive or Dead, and then observes how the pattern evolves.
Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors by following a preset of rules:
 - Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
 - Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
 - Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
 - Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
