Repository for any games built using Python or otherwise.

#### Games:

- __Hi-Lo:__ Based off the classic "Higher or Lower" guessing game - https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/higher-or-lower.html

- __Blackjack:__ Command line implementation of BlackJack (21) - https://wizardofodds.com/games/blackjack/basics/

- __Conway's Game of Life:__ Graphical zero-player cellular automaton game. User provides the "seed", or the games original configuration consisting of cells in one of two states - Alive or Dead, and then observes how the pattern evolves.
Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors by following a preset of rules:
 1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
 2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
 3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
 4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
